 * 
 * This program simulates the classic Tic-Tac-Toe game in a text form.
 * 
 * This game currently only supports two players, no player vs AI!
 * 
 * Once the game is started, the two players will each enter their name into
 * the console. The players will take turns placing X's and O's into the 3x3 grid
 * by choosing a number (1 through 9) that corresponds to the space they would
 * like to play in. Once 1) the board is full or 2) a player places three of 
 * their pieces in a row, the current match will end and the winner (if there
 * is one) will be determined.
 * 
 * Each "game" can last as long as the players are willing to play, and consists
 * of multiple matches. The game will keep score of the number of individual
 * matches each player wins until they choose to end the game.
 *
 * After each turn, an updated board will display in the console so the players
 * can see where the pieces are at and which spots are open.
 * 
 * After each match the players will be presented with a prompt with 3 options:
 * 		1) Continue the current game (starting a new match).
 * 		2) Start a new game (erase the players' scores and start over).
 * 		3) Exit the game (terminate the program).
 * 
 * The 3x3 grid is arranged in this manner:
 * 		1 | 2 | 3
 * 		---------
 * 		4 | 5 | 6
 * 		---------
 * 		7 | 8 | 9
 * To play in a square, the player simply enters the corresponding number.
